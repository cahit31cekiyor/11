##

• General Objective of the Program •

> What this program needs to do is to show in a panel how the computer hardware is doing.
> Temperature status of system components "Processor, Ram, GPU, etc."
> Utilization Rates of System Parts in % "Processor, Ram, GPU Usage and Modem MBPS rate"
##

• Design Phase and Production Phase •

> It needs to be the size of an average box
> The choice of color should be close to gray and black tones
> When opening the application, a visual fade in and then immediately open the application
> Let there be 2 boxes in the application, it would be better if they are in the form of tab menus, one of them says "System Monitoring" and the other says "System Cleaning".
> When the system monitoring button is pressed, the temperature status of the system parts "Processor, Ram, GPU, etc." should be displayed there, in addition to the Utilization Rates of System Parts in % "Processor, Ram, GPU Utilization and Modem MBPS rate" Let's see these too
> When the system cleanup button is pressed, there should be a total of 3 boxes in these boxes, the first one should say "Clear Temp", the second one should say "Clear %temp%", the third one should say "Clear prefetch", and each button should give a warning when pressed, and the warning should say that this is a system file and cannot be reversed.
